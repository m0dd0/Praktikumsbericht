In the published literature there is no lack of algorithms and concepts for robotic object grasping.
Most of the proposed seem to perform well in the respective environements they were tested in.%environments with grasp success rate ov.
However different assumptions made it challenging to compare the results of the different algorithms.
Often no effort is made to put the algorithms in different setting and analyse their performance on.
Especially with deep learning based algorithms it is hard to compare the results as the underlying networks are often trained on a specific dataset
this can often lead to unnoticed overfitting issues. and are not easily transferable to other datasets.
In this report we present a benchmark to compare the performance of different grasping algorithms in a simulated environement using the YCB object dataset.
Using the common task setting we can directly compare the differences in performance between the algorithms.
