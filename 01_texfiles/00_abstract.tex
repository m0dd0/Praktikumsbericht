In the published literature there is no lack of algorithms and concepts for robotic object grasping.
Most of the proposed algorithm seem to perform well in the respective environements they were evaluated in.%environments with grasp success rate ov.
However different a priori assumptions made in the problem formulation and varying evaluation environments make it challenging to compare the results of
the different algorithms in a meaningful way.
% Often no or less effort is made to put the algorithms in different setting and analyse their performance on.
Especially with deep learning based algorithms it is hard to estimate the meaningfullness of presented results as the underlying networks are often trained on a specific dataset
which might causes the algorithms to generalize bad to other environement. % and are not easily transferable to other datasets.
In this report we present a benchmark to compare the performance of different grasping algorithms in a common simulated environement using the YCB object dataset.
Using a shared task, environment and objects to grasp we can directly compare the differences in performance between the different approaches to robotic grasping.
