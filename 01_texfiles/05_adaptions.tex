In order to use the implementation of the benchmarked algorithms in conjuction with the benchmarking framework described in \ref{} we had to adapt
the pre- and postprocessing steps so that they fit the data obtained by the simulation.

The adaptions made to the algorithms are described in the following sections.

\subsection{ContactGraspNet}
While directly offering a 6D grasp representation, there is still some conversion of the Grasp pose necessary in order to obtain a correct grasp in the simulation environement.
This mainly arises from different end effector coordinate systems used by the simulation and the algorithm.
Both representation define the z-axis as the axis along which the object is attempted in order to be grasped.
However, the simulation uses the y-axis as the axis along which the object is grasped while the algorithm uses the x-axis.
This results in the following conversion of the grasp orientation matrix beeing necessary:
