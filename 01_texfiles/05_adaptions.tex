In order to use the implementation of the benchmarked algorithms in conjuction with the benchmarking framework described in \ref{} we had to adapt
the pre- and postprocessing steps so that they fit the data obtained by the simulation.

The adaptions made to the algorithms are described in the following sections.

\subsection{GrConvNet}
\subsection{ContactGraspNet}
\subsection{GGCNN}
